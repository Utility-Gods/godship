As developers, we spend countless hours filling out forms during testing and development. Whether you're building a registration form, testing a checkout process, or validating user input fields, manually entering realistic test data can be tedious and time-consuming. That's where **Fillo** comes in â€“ a Chrome extension that leverages the power of AI to intelligently fill your development forms with contextually appropriate data.

## What is Fillo?

Fillo is a Chrome extension designed specifically for developers working on localhost development sites. It uses advanced AI language models to analyze your form fields and generate realistic, contextually appropriate content that matches the purpose and type of each field. Think of it as your intelligent development assistant that understands what kind of data belongs in your forms.

## Key Features

### ðŸ¤– **Multiple AI Provider Support**
Fillo doesn't lock you into a single AI provider. Choose from:
- **OpenAI** (GPT models)
- **Anthropic** (Claude models)
- **Google** (Gemini models)
- **Ollama** (Local models for complete privacy)

### ðŸŽ¯ **Intelligent Form Detection**
The extension automatically detects form fields on your localhost sites and analyzes:
- Field types and labels
- Form context and purpose
- Page metadata for better understanding

### âš¡ **Smart Caching System**
To optimize performance and reduce API costs:
- Generated content is cached locally
- Reduces duplicate API calls
- Configurable cache expiration (default: 30 days)
- Manual cache clearing options

### ðŸŽ¨ **Customizable Creativity Levels**
Adjust the creativity and variety of generated content based on your testing needs:
- Conservative: Realistic, standard data
- Balanced: Mix of standard and creative entries
- Creative: Diverse, imaginative test data

### ðŸ”’ **Privacy-First Design**
- **Localhost only**: Only operates on development sites
- **Local storage**: All data stored on your device
- **Encrypted API keys**: Your credentials are protected
- **No data collection**: We don't collect or store your information

## Why Fillo Matters for Developers

### **Saves Time**
Stop typing "John Doe" and "john@example.com" repeatedly. Fillo generates diverse, realistic test data instantly.

### **Improves Testing Quality**
Better test data leads to better testing. Fillo generates edge cases and realistic scenarios you might not think of manually.

### **Reduces Development Friction**
Focus on building features, not filling forms. Fillo handles the tedious data entry so you can concentrate on what matters.

### **Supports Multiple Workflows**
Whether you're testing form validation, UI layouts with different data lengths, or database integration, Fillo adapts to your needs.

## How It Works

1. **Install**: Add Fillo to Chrome from the extension store
2. **Configure**: Set up your preferred AI provider and API key
3. **Navigate**: Visit your localhost development site
4. **Fill**: Click the Fillo icon and watch as your forms populate with intelligent data
5. **Test**: Continue with your development workflow using realistic test data

## Security and Privacy

We take your privacy seriously. Fillo implements several security measures:

- **Localhost restriction**: The extension only activates on localhost sites, ensuring no production data exposure
- **API key encryption**: Your AI provider keys are encrypted before storage
- **Minimal permissions**: Only requests necessary Chrome permissions
- **No external data transmission**: Your data isn't sent to Fillo servers

When you use Fillo, your form data is only shared with the AI provider you've chosen to configure, and only for the purpose of generating appropriate content.

## Getting Started

Fillo is perfect for:
- **Frontend developers** testing React, Vue, Angular, or vanilla JavaScript forms
- **Full-stack developers** working on user registration and profile systems
- **QA engineers** needing diverse test data sets
- **Backend developers** testing API endpoints with realistic payloads

## The Future of Development Tools

Fillo represents a new wave of AI-powered development tools that understand context and provide intelligent assistance. By combining the power of modern language models with practical development needs, we're making the development process more efficient and enjoyable.

## Privacy Commitment

As developers ourselves, we understand the importance of privacy and security. Fillo's architecture ensures that:
- Your development data stays local
- API keys are securely encrypted
