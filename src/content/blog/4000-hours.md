### Key Metrics (2017 → 2024)

| Metric | Value |
| ------ | ----- |
| Total billable hours | **4,000** |
| Active years on Upwork | **7** |
| Completed contracts | **48** |
| Distinct clients | **19** |
| Job-Success Score | **100 %** |
| Average rating | **5.0 / 5** |
| Tech stack growth | HTML/CSS/JS → AngularJS → SvelteKit, Go, Python, Kubernetes |
| Largest single engagement | **1,800 hrs / 18 mos** |
| Avg. response time (last 12 mo) | **< 2 hrs** |
| Ongoing retainers | **4** |

### Highlights

1. **Consistency**  
   Averaged **570 billable hours per year**, maintaining full-time availability while expanding skill coverage from front-end to full-stack and DevOps.

2. **Scope Diversification**  
   Projects now span **web apps, microservices, infrastructure as code, and AI-assisted tools**—a deliberate move to reduce single-stack dependency.

3. **Client Retention**  
   **42 %** of new work in 2023–24 came from existing clients, reflecting sustained satisfaction and lowered acquisition costs.

4. **Operational Efficiency**  
   Introduced CI/CD pipelines on **90 %** of 2024 projects, cutting average release cycles from **2 weeks to 2 days**.

5. **Future Target**  
   **10,000 hours by 2030**: projected with a conservative **15 %** YoY increase in billable hours and steady client-retention rates.

### Looking Ahead

The 4,000-hour mark is not a finish line—it’s a performance checkpoint. Goals for the next phase:

- **Deepen AI integration** across client projects (LLM-powered features, automated QA).
- **Expand team capacity** via selective delegation while preserving code-quality metrics.
- **Maintain ≥ 95 % repeat-client ratio** by focusing on long-term partnerships.
